Terms such as “personal data”, “processing”, “data controller”, “data processor”, “personal data breach” etc. shall have the meaning assigned to them under the applicable data protection legislation, such as the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), except for the definition of sub-processor which explicitly excludes telecom carriers and other telecom service providers which are deemed necessary for the operation of the Services, yet, due to the fact that such parties are acting as a mere conduit or as an independent data controller, do not fall under the definition of data processor as stated in the Data Protection Legislation. Additionally, the definitions of: “controller” includes “Business”; &quot;processor&quot; includes “Service Provider”; “data subject” includes “Consumer”; “personal data” includes “Personal Information”; in each case as defined under the PDPA.
3Rych and Customer both acknowledge and agree that the exchange of personal data between the Parties does not form part of any monetary or other valuable consideration exchanged between the Parties with respect to the Agreement or this DPA.

These measures shall be appropriate to the level of risk presented by the processing (and having regard to the nature of the personal data) and to the harm which might result from a personal data breach affecting the personal data;</li><li>provide Customer with any assistance as reasonably requested by Customer in order to allow Customer to comply with obligations of Customer under the Data Protection Legislation, including the notification of personal data breaches, security of processing and assisting Customer with the performance of any relevant data protection impact assessment;</li><li>provide Customer with reasonable assistance in order to allow Customer to comply with its obligations to data subjects who exercise their rights under the Data Protection Legislation. 3Rych will make available technical and organizational measures to allow Customer to fulfil these obligations via the account of Customer. Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that requests sent by Customer via email are not considered as a valid means to exercise its rights and that any such requests will not be processed by 3Rych.

met.</li><li>Given the nature of the Services, the use of the Services by Customer and Customer’s End-Users may require the transfer of personal data outside the EEA; when the performance of the Services involves a transfer of personal data to sub-processors outside the EEA, Customer hereby gives 3Rych a mandate for the term of all agreements in place between Customer and 3Rych to enter into EU Model Contract Clauses with sub-processors outside the EEA on behalf of Customer, if no other appropriate transfer mechanisms under the Data Protection Legislation apply.</li><li>3Rych will take all available and appropriate contractual measures to ensure that when a sub- processor is engaged:<ol><li>the sub-processor will only process personal data if such processing is necessary for performance of the Services or a part thereof, and comply with the specific instructions stated in the Agreement, and;</li><li>data protection obligations providing similar protection as those in this DPA shall be imposed on the sub-processor by way of a contract or other legal act under EU or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.</li></ol></li><li>3Rych remains liable to Customer under this DPA for the performance of the data protection obligations of its sub-processor.</li><li>3Rych hereby certifies that it understands all its contractual restrictions set out in the CCPA and will comply with them, to the extent applicable.</li><li>Details of the processing:<ol><li>Subject matter and purpose of the processing: provision of the Services of 3Rych to Customer.</li><li>Categories of personal data: information on End-Users that Customer provides to 3Rych through the Services.</li><li>Categories of data subjects: data subjects can include customers of the Customer, employees, suppliers, and any other natural person who is the End-User of Services, from whom Customer provides personal data through the use of the Services.</li><li>Duration of the processing: personal data will be processed for as long as required for the performance of the Services, or as required under applicable law.</li></ol></li><li>This Data Processing Annex is governed by the laws of Malaysia, and the Parties
