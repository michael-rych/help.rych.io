# Rych Beta Terms and Conditions

Thank you for participating in the Rych Beta Program. These Rych Beta Program Terms (“Terms”) apply to and govern your participation in any or all of public or private beta programs (“BetaProgram“) and use of Rych’s Beta Services (“Beta Services”). In order to participate in a Beta Program or use Beta Services, you must agree to these terms. We have provided abbreviated language to help you navigate some of the legalese below.

1. **Eligibility and Participation**

    **We only allow invited customers to participate in Beta and require that customers be in good standing (e.g. up to date billing, not currently in suspension). The Rych Terms of Service in addition to these terms applies to your use of Beta Services. That means that both agreements govern the Beta Services.**

    You may participate in a Beta Program and use Beta Services only upon request and approval by Rych (“us” “Rych” “us” or “we’), and/ or by invitation from us. Only Customers in good standing may participate in a Beta Program and use Beta Services, subject to the Rych Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) and must remain so for the duration of these Terms. The Rych Terms of Service (including the Rych Privacy Policy and Product Privacy Policy) are incorporated by reference and will control for any provisions not addressed in these Terms. The Terms of Service continue to apply with regard to your use of the Rych Services, participation in a Beta Program, and use of any Beta Services. In the event that you are no longer a customer of Rych, your participation in the Beta Program and your use of all Beta Services will be terminated.

1. **Beta Services**

    **Beta Services may range from wholly new product lines to changes to existing product features. We’re giving you a license to use the Beta Services.**

    The Beta Services may be a separate, stand-alone service, accessible apart from the currently available Rych Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) or may be a feature or functionality for existing Rych Services. A description of the Beta Service may be provided prior to or at the time you use a Beta Service, or if we make changes to the Beta Service. By agreeing to and complying with these Terms we grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, nontransferable, limited license to use the Beta Services.

    **The Beta Services Are As Is**

    **Beta features by their very nature are meant for testing, which means that they may not work as expected, may have errors, or may cause unintended behaviours. You understand that we’re not responsible for any issues or problems caused by the Beta Service. We have no obligation to provide any kind of support for the Beta Services**

    By accepting these Terms or using the Beta Services, you understand and acknowledge that the Beta Services are being provided as a “Beta” version and made available on an “As Is” or “As Available” basis. The Beta Services may contain bugs, errors, and other problems.

    **If we publish your feedback about the Beta, we’ll be sure to either not identify you, or will contact you to get your permission to use your name.**

    The Beta Services are made available to you for the purposes of evaluation and feedback without any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Rych. You acknowledge the importance of communication between you and Rych during your use of the Beta Services and agree to receive related correspondence and updates from us. In the event you request to opt out from such communications, your participation in the Beta Program will be terminated, and your use of the applicable Beta Services will likewise be discontinued.

    As part of using the Beta Services, you will be asked to provide feedback regarding your use of the Beta Services. You acknowledge that Rych owns any feedback provided, and you hereby grant to us, if for any reason it is further needed, a perpetual, non-revocable, royalty-free worldwide license to use and/or incorporate such feedback into any of our products or services at any time at our sole discretion. If we chose to publish such feedback, we will either do so in a way that does not identify you or seek your consent in the event we do wish to identify you.
