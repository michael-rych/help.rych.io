# How do I link my existing customer’s profile from a different channel under the same profile?

If you get a new message from an existing customer and it is from a different channel, link to an existing profile with these steps.

Step 1: Click that new **chat name (Red Font)<sup>*</sup>** initiated by an existing customer and click on green **Build Profile** button where there will be an option Link To An Existing Profile.

>## Red Font
> If a customer’s name appears in red with a hazard logo it means that contact does not have a profile in your database. Once you added the contact in your profile database the contact’s name will be in Black.
