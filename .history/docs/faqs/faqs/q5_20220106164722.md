# What if my Active Profiles (AP) are fully utilized before the end of my subscription period/ dateline? Will my services remain active?

All services will remain active within the usage period. An upgrade plan is highly recommended should your Active Profiles (AP) are fully utilized. You can recycle your AP by removing profiles which are non active.
