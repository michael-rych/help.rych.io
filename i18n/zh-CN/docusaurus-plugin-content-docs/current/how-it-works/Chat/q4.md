# How do I reply to new incoming messages and close them once I am done?

All new incoming messages are smartly segregated into a list in a single view. There will be 3 professional ticketing lists.

1. **Unassigned** - The “Unassigned” list display messages that are yet to be attended by any of the team members.
2. **Open** - The “Open” list is where your team member will be replying to messages privately.
3. **Close** - Once a team member has successfully solved a customer’s inquiries, moved the message over to the “Close” list.
