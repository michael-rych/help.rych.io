# How Do I Connect to Google Sheets?

Rych can read contents from preselected Google Sheets to automatically send a "Welcome Message" to new entries. This feature is commonly used in conjunction with Google Forms, where new entries in Google Forms are updated in Google Sheets, which Rych then picks up. This is particularly useful for events or presentations where customers fill in forms that include contact details.

:::info Name and Contact Details
Since Rych saves customer details into an Active Profile and automatically sends a welcome message, it is crucial that at least the first name and contact details are present.
