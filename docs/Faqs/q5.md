# What if my Active Profiles (AP) are fully utilized before the end of my subscription?

Unfortunately, you are no longer able to save new profiles once your Active Profiles (AP) pool is fully utilized. Upgrading a plan is easy inside RYCH. New chats will be removed from RYCH after 24 hours if a profile is not saved.
