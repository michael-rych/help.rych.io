# I have my customerâ€™s information, but how do I create a profile without request from the customer?

We have a tab specifically for profiles where you can manage existing or create new profiles. Follow this simple step to create a new profile for your customers to keep in their database.

Step 1: Click on the green button to categorise the profile as customer or vendor.
